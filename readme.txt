== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need a special key? =

Not exactly. 
The plugin will work if you choose to support the site (via a link).
If not then yes, you need a special "activation" key. You can talk with the where2ski.net admin and ask for a key. The process is in development so that a more automated
option will exist in future releases.
